A BTD6 Collection Event Expert Impoppable Auto Farmer

To run this, there are a few things to note:
- You need python
- Resolution must be 1280x720 (16:9)
- Auto Start must be turned off
- Benjamin must be the selected hero
- Double Cash Mode and Fast Track are required (I may make a non-DCM non-FT version of this in the future.)
- Full Monkey Knowledge is basically a necessity
- You also need default controls (with the exception of "Reverse Change Targeting" set to backquote (`)


A few important things to note in general:
- There is no protection against leveling up mid-game
- There is no protection against dying mid-game
- The strats are fairly consistent. They have yet to fail (albeit Dark Dungeons and Ravine are the most scuffed. I may edit these strats)

- TO INSTALL -
Put every script in the same directory somewhere and install python requirements.

- TO RUN -
Ensure everything is configured correctly and go into the BTD6 game with your bonus rewards expert map loaded, then run mapidentifier.py, after that, you have three seconds to alt-tab into the game for it to do its thing.
(You may need to run the scripts as admin/superuser in order for it to work properly)
